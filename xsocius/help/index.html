<h2>Opening Crossword Puzzles<a class="headerlink" href="#opening-crossword-puzzles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can open puzzles stored on your computer. These puzzles can be
in the popular &#8220;Across Lite&#8221; <cite>(.puz)</cite> format.</p>
<p>To open a disk-based crossword, you can start one of several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">If you get the &#8220;welcome&#8221; box when you start up, you can click on

<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Diagramless Puzzles</p>
<p class="last">A small number of crossword puzzles online are &#8220;diagramless puzzles&#8221;,
where part of the challenge is to discover the shape itself of the board
and the placement of the clues. LeahWords cannot open such puzzles.
This may be added in a later version.</p>

<span id="document-webopen"></span><div class="section" id="web-crossword-puzzles">
<h2>Web Crossword Puzzles<a class="headerlink" href="#web-crossword-puzzles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can open puzzles directly from a number of popular crossword sites.
There are sites that are pre-configured in the program, and you can
add other sites as well (see Preferences).</p>
<p>To open a web-based crossword, you can start one of several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">If you get the &#8220;welcome&#8221; box when you start up, you can click on
<cite>Open Web Puzzle</cite>. This will give you a dialog of sites to choose from.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Choose <cite>File</cite> → <cite>Web Puzzle Chooser</cite>. This will give you the same
dialog.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Choose <cite>File</cite> → <cite>Open Web Puzzle</cite> and pick the puzzle directly from
the submenu. This will open the most recently-available puzzle from
that puzzle source.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="web-puzzle-chooser">
<h3>Web Puzzle Chooser<a class="headerlink" href="#web-puzzle-chooser" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Web Puzzle chooser shows the sites you can select a puzzle from, along
with a date-picker to choose the date to begin looking for the selected puzzle:</p>
<div class="figure" id="id1">
<img alt="_images/sites.gif" src="_images/sites.gif" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Web Puzzle Chooser.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Different puzzles are released on different days of the week; you can find
out which days puzzles are expected, along with a description of the puzzle
source, in descriptive text below the list.</p>
<p>For example, the New York Times Classic puzzle is released every Monday. If you
leave the date picker on the default, today&#8217;s date, it will automatically look
backward to the first Monday on or before today, and open that puzzle.  If you
wanted to specifically look for the puzzle released last week, you could change
the date picker to last Monday (or any date last week before this Monday, since
it knows to only look for this puzzle on Mondays).</p>
<p>In the event that a puzzle cannot be found on an expected day, it will continue
looking backwards until it finds a puzzle or it fails 3 attempts.</p>
<p>Once a puzzle is opened, it is saved in your Web Puzzles directory
and opened up for play.</p>

<div class="section" id="puzzle-board">
<h3>Puzzle Board<a class="headerlink" href="#puzzle-board" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Depending on the choices you made in preferences, the list of clues for your
puzzle may or may not appear on the right-hand side of the puzzle grid.
Regardless, as you move around the puzzle, the currently selected clue will
appear in bold over the grid.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="moving-around">
<h3>Moving Around<a class="headerlink" href="#moving-around" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can move around the board with the arrow keys. This will change direction
and then begin moving in the new direction. You can also use the mouse to click
on a cell.</p>
<p>To switch the current direction, you can use the <cite>Enter</cite> key or the spacebar.</p>
<p>You can also click in a clue list to jump to the square that begins that clue.
You can also press <cite>Tab</cite> to move onto a clue list and then up/down arrow to
choose a clue, followed by <cite>Enter</cite> to move back to the board for that space.</p>
<p>For full instructions on keyboard shortcuts during puzzle solving, see
<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#my-keyboard-shortcuts"><span>Keyboard Navigation</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="entering-letters">
<h3>Entering Letters<a class="headerlink" href="#entering-letters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To enter letters in the grid, you can just type them. Depending on the choices
you chose in the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#my-keyboard-navigation"><span>Keyboard Navigation</span></a> section
of the preferences, letters that are already filled in may be skipped over
so you don&#8217;t have to type them.</p>
<p>Some puzzles contain &#8220;rebuses&#8221;: cells where the answer isn&#8217;t a single letter
but a symbol or a word. For example, a puzzle may have the words &#8220;HEART&#8221;,
&#8220;SPADES&#8221;, &#8220;CLUBS&#8221;, and &#8220;DIAMONDS&#8221; in four spaces rather than simple
letters. If a puzzle has rebus spaces, you can enter these using <cite>Edit</cite>
→ <cite>Enter Special Characters</cite>.</p>
<p>Normally, when the puzzle has been completed, a dialog will pop up to
congratuate you. If you do not want this automatic notification of a completed
puzzle, you can disable this in the preferences, in
<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#my-tournament-settings"><span>Disable auto-notification of puzzle completion</span></a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="pencil-versus-pen">
<h3>Pencil versus Pen<a class="headerlink" href="#pencil-versus-pen" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to note which answers you&#8217;re less sure of, you can switch to
&#8220;pencil mode&#8221;. To do this, choose <cite>Edit</cite> → <cite>Use Pencil</cite> (or use the
keyboard shortcut), or click the pencil icon at the bottom of the
puzzle window. Answers filled out in pencil are lighter and not in bold. To
switch back to pen mode, choose <cite>Edit</cite> → <cite>Use Pen</cite>, or click the
pencil icon back out.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you&#8217;ve filled out a square in pencil or pen, LeahWords works
the same with regard to checking your work, considering the puzzle solved, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="checking-your-work">
<h3>Checking Your Work<a class="headerlink" href="#checking-your-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can check the current letter, current word, or entire puzzle for errors.
These choices are in the <cite>Puzzle</cite> → <cite>Check</cite> submenu.</p>
<p>Once checked, cells that were correct remain unmarked. Squares that have
errors will be marked. Once the correct answer has been put in the cells, they
will be marked differently to show that they were once incorrect, but have
been corrected:</p>

<h3>Locked Puzzles<a class="headerlink" href="#locked-puzzles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some puzzles ship with solutions that are encrypted. These puzzles cannot
usually be checked nor can the solution be revealed.</p>
<p>For encrypted puzzles, there is an option, <cite>Puzzle</cite> → <cite>Unlock
Puzzle</cite>.  This decrypts the solution by guessing every possible key. On a
slower computer, this may take a few minutes. After the solution has bene
decrypted, you can check or reveal answers as usual.</p>
<p>You can also choose to lock a puzzle to encrpyt the solution by using
<cite>Puzzle</cite> → <cite>Lock Puzzle</cite>. You will be prompted for a 4-digit key to
use to encrypt the puzzle (a random one will be displayed as a suggestion).
Once locked, the puzzle must be unlocked to view the solution or check answers.</p>
<p>In the preferences, there are options for &#8220;<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#my-tournament-settings"><span>Tournament Settings</span></a>&#8221;,

<p>With LeahWords, you can solve a crossword puzzle online together with one
or more other friends.</p>
<p>To do so, you will both need instant messaging accounts on systems that work
with the Jabber/XMPP protocol. Google Talk is a very well-known example of this
type of system, but many other IM servers offer these types of accounts.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">While Facebook can connect to XMPP servers, it does not implement enough
of the protocol to be used. At this time, you cannot use your Facebook
IM account to play puzzles together.</p>
</div>
<p>On most IM systems, members cannot send messages to each other until they have
subscribed to each other (some systems may call this &#8220;Adding a user&#8221;,
&#8220;Friending a user&#8221;, or similar things). You should make sure you have
subscribed to each other before attempting to play games together. A good way
to test this is to send messages using your normal IM client (such as Google
Talk).</p>
<p>It is possible for the players to share a single IM account to play together,
however, they will have to connect using manual invitations (see below).</p>

<h3>Sharing a Puzzle<a class="headerlink" href="#sharing-a-puzzle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<h3>Solving Collaboratively<a class="headerlink" href="#solving-collaboratively" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve connected to each other, you can solve the puzzle together.
Almost all of the features work the same&#8211;you can move around, fill in squares,
clear squares, check your work, reveal answers, etc. Any change made on one
person&#8217;s puzzle is immediately shown to the other players.</p>
<p>So as not to confuse users when one uses undo or redo and the others do not,
undo/redo are disabled when working on shared puzzles.</p>
<p>There may be times you want to draw your friends&#8217; attention to a particular
word on the puzzle (perhaps you&#8217;re stumped on it, or want to brag about solving
a particularly clever clue). You can highlight this clue on their end
by selecting the word in the puzzle grid and then choosing <cite>Puzzle</cite> →
<cite>Highlight Answer</cite>. This will cause that word to stay lit up in pink on both
your board and your friends&#8217; boards, making it easier to notice.</p>

</div>
<p>Like in many other IM systems, you can start a message with &#8220;/me&#8221; to make it
look like a &#8220;status message&#8221;: for example, &#8220;/me is amazed at your skill&#8221; will
appear in italics on your friends&#8217; computers as &#8220;(yourname) is amazed at your
skill&#8221;. If you really need to get the attention of the other solvers,
you can start your message with &#8220;/popup&#8221; (like &#8220;/popup I have to stop in
3 minutes&#8221;), which will cause a box to pop up on their screens.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d rather have the keyboard focus stay in the message entry box so you

<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Advanced Material</p>
<p>This section suggests how you can automate downloading of puzzles
from sites that require log in via cookies, such as the New York
Times premium site. This requires you to edit files on disk in
very particular formats, and may be challenging for more basic users.</p>
<p class="last">Alternatively, if this process doesn&#8217;t work or is confusing, you could
always download the paid puzzles using a standard web browser and then
open them up as file puzzles.</p>
</div>
<p>Some web sites that offer crossword puzzles are subscription sites (most
notably, The New York Times). While the Times offers a free &#8220;classic&#8221; puzzle
once a week, this is often a decade-old puzzle from their archives. For
access to their daily puzzle, you need a paid subscription.</p>
<p>LeahWords can open web puzzles from many subscription sites, but does
require you to edit a text file to put in the proper cookie information from
the site.</p>
<p>First, using any web browser, go to the subscription site, log in, and
retrieve a puzzle.</p>
<p>Look at the list of cookies stored in your browser. There should be
at least one cookie for the site which is used for log in information
for the site. For some sites, there may be many
cookies stored, many having to do with other features like ads of preferences,
and it may require some experimentation to find the login cookie.</p>
<p>For the New York Times, the log in cookie is called &#8220;NYT-S&#8221;.</p>
<p>Edit the &#8220;cookies.txt&#8221; file that came with this program. This will be
in different places depending on your operating system:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><em>Windows</em>: in your home directory, in <cite>.LeahWords</cite>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Linux</em>: in your home directory, in <cite>.LeahWords</cite>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>OSX</em>: in your home directory, in <cite>Library/Application Support/LeahWords</cite>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit this file to add a line for your new cookie. A sample line is already in
this file for the New York Times (though the sample cookie data provided is
fictional and won&#8217;t work).</p>
<p>The format is:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Set-Cookie3: COOKIENAME=&quot;cookie-string&quot;; path=&quot;/&quot;; domain=&quot;.site.com&quot;;
  path_spec; domain_dot; expires=&quot;expiration-date&quot;; version=0
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>This should be entered as one line, without any linebreaks or return
characters</strong> (the example above is on separate lines just to make it more
readable here).  You can copy and paste the cookie string, domain, and
expiration date from your web browser&#8217;s cookie listing.</p>
<p>If you are trying to enable puzzles for the New York Times, you can simply
replace the sample cookie-string data in the example line with your real cookie
data. For other sites, you can create a new line like the sample one.</p>

<h2>License<a class="headerlink" href="#license" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p id="my-license"><strong>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</strong></p>
<p><em>Version 3, 29 June 2007</em></p>
<p>Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p><strong>PREAMBLE</strong></p>
<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and
other kinds of works.</p>
<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
versions of a program&#8211;to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most
of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its
authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights
or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you
must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert
copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>
<p>For the developers&#8217; and authors&#8217; protection, the GPL clearly explains that
there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#8217; and authors&#8217; sake,
the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that
their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous
versions.</p>
<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This
is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#8217; freedom to
change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of
products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most
unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit
the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other
domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>
<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special
danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to
render the program non-free.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.</p>
<p><strong>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong></p>
<p>0. <strong>Definitions.</strong>
“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p>&#8220;Copyright&#8221; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,
such as semiconductor masks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Program&#8221; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
Each licensee is addressed as &#8220;you&#8221;. &#8220;Licensees&#8221; and &#8220;recipients&#8221; may be
individuals or organizations.</p>
<p>To &#8220;modify&#8221; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.
The resulting work is called a &#8220;modified version&#8221; of the earlier work or a work
“based on” the earlier work.</p>
<p>A &#8220;covered work&#8221; means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
Program.</p>
<p>To &#8220;propagate&#8221; a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under
applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a
private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without
modification), making available to the public, and in some countries
other activities as well.</p>
<p>To &#8220;convey&#8221; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to
make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>
<p>An interactive user interface displays &#8220;Appropriate Legal Notices&#8221; to the
extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)
displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there
is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are
provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License,
and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of
user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list
meets this criterion.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Source Code.</strong> The &#8220;source code&#8217; for a work means the preferred form of
the work for making modifications to it. &#8220;Object code&#8221; means any non-source
form of a work.</p>
<p>A &#8220;Standard Interface&#8221; means an interface that either is an official standard
defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified
for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers
working in that language.</p>
<p>The &#8220;System Libraries&#8221; of an executable work include anything, other than the
work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only
to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard
Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code
form. A &#8220;Major Component&#8221;, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an
object code interpreter used to run it.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Corresponding Source&#8221; for a work in object code form means all the source
code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object
code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.
However, it does not include the work&#8217;s System Libraries, or general-purpose
tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in
performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example,
Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated
with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
parts of the work.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Basic Permissions.</strong> All rights granted under this License are granted for
the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission
to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is
covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a
covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other
equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>
<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey
covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications
exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,
provided that you comply with the terms of this License in
conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.
Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so
exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on
terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted
material outside their relationship with you.</p>
<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
unnecessary.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Protecting Users&#8217; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</strong> No covered
work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any
applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright
treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting
circumvention of such measures.</p>
<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered
work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the
work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#8217;s users, your or third parties&#8217;
legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Conveying Verbatim Copies.</strong> You may convey verbatim copies of the
Program&#8217;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep
intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a
copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may
offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Conveying Modified Source Versions.</strong> You may convey a work based on the
Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of
source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:</p>
<p>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and
giving a relevant date.  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that
it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.
This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to &#8220;keep intact all
notices&#8221;.  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore
apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of
the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License
gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.  d) If the work
has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices;
however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display
Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.</p>
<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are
not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation
and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights
of the compilation&#8217;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion
of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the
other parts of the aggregate.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Conveying Non-Source Forms.</strong> You may convey a covered work in object code
form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one
of these ways:</p>
<p>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on
a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.  b) Convey
the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical
distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at
least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer
support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2)
access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only
occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code
with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.  d) Convey the object
code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge),
and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way
through the same place at no further charge. You need not require
recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If
the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding
Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that
supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear
directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding
Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to
satisfy these requirements.  e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer
transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and
Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at
no charge under subsection 6d.</p>
<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the
Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the
object code work.</p>
<p>A &#8220;User Product&#8221; is either (1) a &#8220;consumer product&#8221;, which means any tangible
personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household
purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.
In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be
resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a
particular user, &#8220;normally used&#8221; refers to a typical or common use of that
class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use,
the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the
product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless
such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>
<p>&#8220;Installation Information&#8221; for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute
modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified
version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure
that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case
prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.</p>
<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a
transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is
transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of
how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source
conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation
Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third
party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product
(for example, the work has been installed in ROM).</p>
<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a
work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be
denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication
across the network.</p>
<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord
with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an
implementation available to the public in source code form), and must
require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Additional Terms.</strong> &#8220;Additional permissions&#8221; are terms that supplement the
terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be
treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they
are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of
the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the
additional permissions.</p>
<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain
cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions
on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give
appropriate copyright permission.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a
covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)
supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>
<p>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of
sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified
reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the
Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting
misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified
versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the
original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of
licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under
trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f)
Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone
who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual
assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.</p>
<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &#8220;further restrictions&#8221;
within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any
part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along
with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a
license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or
conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed
by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction
does not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>
<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place,
in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply
to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.</p>
<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a
separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements
apply either way.</p>
<p>8. <strong>Termination.</strong> You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of
section 11).</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation
by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation
of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses
of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If
your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not
qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.</p>
<p>9. <strong>Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</strong> You are not required to
accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary
propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using
peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to
propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered
work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>
<p>10. <strong>Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</strong> Each time you convey a
covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You
are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
License.</p>
<p>An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives
a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#8217;s
predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a
right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the
predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with
reasonable efforts.</p>
<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a
license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this
License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed
by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
portion of it.</p>
<p>11. <strong>Patents.</strong> A &#8220;contributor&#8221; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under
this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work
thus licensed is called the contributor&#8217;s &#8220;contributor version&#8221;.</p>
<p>A contributor&#8217;s &#8220;essential patent claims&#8221; are all patent claims owned or
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License,
of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not
include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of
further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of
this definition, &#8220;control&#8221; includes the right to grant patent
sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
License.</p>
<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under the contributor&#8217;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,
offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the
contents of its contributor version.</p>
<p>In the following three paragraphs, a &#8220;patent license&#8221; is any express agreement
or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express
permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent
infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to
make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.</p>
<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of
charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available
network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to
deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly
relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license,
your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&#8217;s use of
the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable
patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>
<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you
convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a
patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing
them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
recipients of the covered work and works based on it.</p>
<p>A patent license is &#8220;discriminatory&#8221; if it does not include within the scope of
its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise
of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.
You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a
third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you
make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of
conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent
license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or
copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection
with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless
you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to
28 March 2007.</p>
<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied
license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to
you under applicable patent law.</p>
<p>12. <strong>No Surrender of Others&#8217; Freedom.</strong> If conditions are imposed on you
(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions
of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If
you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms
that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom
you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and
this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>
<p>13. <strong>Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</strong> Notwithstanding any
other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any
covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General
Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.
The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public
License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.</p>
<p>14. <strong>Revised Versions of this License.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may
publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time
to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License &#8220;or any later
version&#8221; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number
of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the
GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#8217;s public statement of
acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for
the Program.</p>
<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.</p>
<p>15. <strong>Disclaimer of Warranty.</strong> THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS
WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<p>16. <strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW
OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO
MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p>17. <strong>Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</strong> If the disclaimer of warranty and
limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect
according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most
closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection
with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>
