Printing
========

Under the file menu, there are options to set up your printer, preview, or
print your puzzle. The puzzles are always printed on a single page--the puzzle
grid will be printed at a fixed size, and the clues are resized as needed to
fit.

Saving
======

You can save your work by choosing "Save" in the "File" menu, 
or choose to save your puzzle under
a different name or location by choosing "Save As".
