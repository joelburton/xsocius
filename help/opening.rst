Opening Crossword Puzzles
=========================

You can open puzzles stored on your computer. These puzzles can be
in the popular "Across Lite" `(.puz)` format.

To open a disk-based crossword, you can start one of several ways:

- If you get the "welcome" box when you start up, you can click on
  `Open File Puzzle`. This will prompt you for the file.

- Choose `File` |rarr| `Open File Puzzle`. This will give you the same
  dialog.

- Choose `File` |rarr| `Recent Files` and select a recently-opened puzzle 
  from the list.

.. note:: Diagramless Puzzles

   A small number of crossword puzzles online are "diagramless puzzles",
   where part of the challenge is to discover the shape itself of the board
   and the placement of the clues. |NAME| cannot open such puzzles.
   This may be added in a later version.
