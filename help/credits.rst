This program is written in the open source language `Python
<http://python.org>`_, and uses the `wxPython <http://wxpython.org>`_
GUI system and the `SleekXMPP <http://sleekxmpp.com>`_ library
for XMPP (Jabber) communication. *Nani gigantum humeris insidentes*.

The author wishes to thank Alex DeJarnatt for his kind
permission to include his "puzpy" `.puz` file format parser. In order
to update this program to Python 3, considerable changes to it
were made.

Thanks also to Robin Dunn and the other members of the wxPython
community for their answers to questions about this framework.

Special thanks to the beta testers (in alphabetical order):
Buffy Baumann, Lois Burton, Leah Cole, Besha Grey, Geoff Marchand, 
Oliver Tessier, and Dena Witkes.
